Learning project - just a simple GUI CRUD+list project using Python 3.12, SQLite 3, and Tk, TTk.

Along the way, learning basic python, Optional[T] types, packages and search path, logging, type hints
and MyPy, pip, venvs, and VS Code Python support.

I have decided I like PyCharm a bit better than VSCode, so I'm using it for the moment.

General thoughts: I like static languages better.  TKInter is a rough fit for Python, even if it is usually built in.  Debugger shows all sorts of weird instance attributes.  And Python's language and library docs leave much to be desired.  Although it might take a rich commercial sponsor to improve it significantly.  VSCode and PyCharm could each improve their product greatly with a reasonable competent F1-help facility.  Edit-and-run performance is reasonable.  GitHub integration is great.  Python's lint tools are kind of fun, but they get a bit ridiculous when spell-checking short literal strings.  I can't really predict how well my Python ease of use and satisfaction will improve with experience.
